## About Me
Program development has mostly been a hobby, not an avocation. I am expert in **C**. spent some years with **Java**, and program and configure databases. 

### Linux and me
My journey to Linux began when the alternative Windows Desktop called `DesqView/X` by **Quarterdeck Systems**. then with `SCO/Xenix`, and finally, my distro of choice, `Slackware` in the late '90s which I continue to use and support to this day. I run Windows only when I have to, and that, under a VM.

### Professional
I have been a consultant where I used C and designed and configured databases in a variety of industry verticals:
* Television, Film, Media, and Advertising
* Recording arts
* Banking, Insurance, and Financial Services
* Healthcare and Life Sciences

### Some career highlights:
* Developed one of the first Ratings Analysis Systems for the Cable TV Industry
* Debugged and reprogrammed a global stock market index database that was providing inaccurate results by 200 basis points
* Designed Executive Compensation Systems used by a multi-national in 63 countries
* Designed and Developed a Music Video Licensing System
* Was Product Manager at an Enterprise Quality Management Software company
* More recently, have been involved in Regulatory Compliance for Medical Device, Biotech, and Pharma Companies designing and configuring reporting systems for Adverse Events, Device Registrations, CAPA, etc.

### Github Activities
[lrzip-next](https://github.com/pete4abw/lrzip-next) is the project I work on the most. It is a detached fork of the `lrzip` long range data compression program by Con Kolivas. I began contributing to that project in 2007 and eventually, my modifications became too divergent to manage two forks. So, `lrzip-next` was born in 2019 and continues to this day. The branch **bzip3_poc** is a proposed expansion of compression routines.

[makesbld](https://github.com/pete4abw/makesbld) is a shell program to create `Slackware` Build files. Similar to Gentoo ebuilds, it uses a library of shell functions to systemetize package automation.

[Kernel-Install](https://github.com/pete4abw/Kernel-Install) is a shell script to automate upgrading and installing kernels.

[lrzip-fe](https://github.com/pete4abw/lrzip-fe) is a shell script using `Dialog` to launch `lrzip-next` with all options menu-selectable (although this project is a little behind right now).

Other projects are also available for perusal but are not as actively maintained. [ps2lrz](https://github.com/pete4abw/ps2lrz) is an intereting one because it has the capability to rewrite `lrzip` and `lrzip-next` headers or just decode them. Interesting stuff!
